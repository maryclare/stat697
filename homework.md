Homework

## General Guidelines
* Always due by 11:59pm on Mondays, submitted online via Moodle as a `.pdf`.
* Problems that require use of `R` must be written up using `R` Markdown. 
    - You can find some example `R` Markdown syntax in [solutions from last year's homework assignments](https://github.com/maryclare/atsa/homework).     - You can make a `.pdf` file by either compiling an `.Rmd` file directly to `.pdf` (this may require that you have additional software installed on your computer) or by compiling an `.Rmd` file to `.html`, opening it in your browser, and then saving it as a `.pdf`.
* Raw `R` output alone will not be accepted as a solution.
* Figures and tables must be clearly and fully annotated.
