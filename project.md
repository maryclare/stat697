## Submitting a Potential Dataset

It is ok (and encouraged) to submit as a group! For full consideration, the submission should include the data (in whatever format you have it in, e.g. Excel or .csv) and an at most one page description which includes:

- One to five sentences describing the data, specifically:
    - The names of the students in the group;
    - How the data was obtained;
    - What the data are measuring;
    - The number of observations (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just describe the number of observations for a single one)
    - The amount of time between each observed value.
    
- A single time series plot (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just pick one);
- A sample autocorrelation plot;
- A sample partial autocorrelation plot.

All students who submit at least one potential dataset will have a single bonus point added to their final project grade.

Here are some links to some places to look for data, which range from data repositories that contain cleaned datasets that are often used to demonstrate various concepts to places where raw (uncleaned) time series data is available for download:

Before spring break, I will collect potential datasets. Over spring break, I will explore the submitted data and decide which ones seem well suited for the project.
