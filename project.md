-------


Summary of Tasks:
  
- Submit a data set;
- Choose a data set from the approved datasets for ARIMA modeling
- Submit first analysis as part of homework - to be assigned
- Choose a data set from the approved datasets for state-space modeling
- Submit second analysis as part of homework - to be assigned
- Submit final paper on Friday, 4/24/20 by 11:59pm. See below for guidelines.

## Rubric for Final Paper
  
The final project will be:
- 5 pages long including figures and tables, excluding `R` code and references;
- Double spaced, with font size 12 and approximate 1 inch margins;
    - If you are using `R` Markdown and cannot figure out how to achieve double spacing, you can single-space but then make sure that your final draft is no more than 3 pages long;
- Written using the word processing software of your choosing;
- Be accompanied by `R` code that reproduces all results.
  
## Submitting a Potential Dataset

It is ok (and encouraged) to submit as a group! For full consideration, the submission should include the data (in whatever format you have it in, e.g. Excel or .csv) and an at most one page description which includes:

- One to five sentences describing the data, specifically:
    - The names of the students in the group;
    - How the data was obtained;
    - What the data are measuring;
    - The number of observations (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just describe the number of observations for a single one)
    - The amount of time between each observed value.
    
- A single time series plot (if the data you're interested in contains multiple time series, just pick one);
- A sample autocorrelation plot;
- A sample partial autocorrelation plot.

All students who submit at least one potential dataset will have a single bonus point added to their final project grade.

Here are some links to some places to look for data, which range from data repositories that contain cleaned datasets that are often used to demonstrate various concepts to places where raw (uncleaned) time series data is available for download:

- [`nbastatR` Package for `R`](http://asbcllc.com/nbastatR/)

Before spring break, I will collect potential datasets. Over spring break, I will explore the submitted data and decide which ones seem well suited for the project.
